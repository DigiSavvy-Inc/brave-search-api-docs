## Brave Search API privacy notice

 Updated 8 August 2025

 The Brave Search API is provided by Brave Software Inc located in the U.S.

 #### FOR API CUSTOMERS

 You must create an account and subscribe to a plan to gain access to the Brave Search API. Data
    types marked with * indicate mandatory fields. You will need to provide payment details, and
    your postal address and billing details. Payment information is processed and held by Stripe and is subject
    to Stripe's privacy policy. Brave
    does not have access to the personal data processed by Stripe. All subscription plans require
    payment information, even if you choose a Free plan (this is to help us safeguard against misuse
    of the service).

 A record of search queries submitted to the Brave Search API via a customer’s Search API account
    is retained for a maximum of 90 days for the purpose of billing Search API account holders and
    for troubleshooting.

 As per Section 3b of the Terms Of Service the Brave Search API customer (Licensee) is solely responsible for complying with applicable data
    protection law including the posting of any privacy notice with regard to queries submitted by end
    users via the customer’s API access. Brave does not collect any identifiers that can link a search
    query to an individual or their devices.

 You can contact our data protection officer at privacy@brave.com should you have any privacy enquiries about the use of account related data, and to the extent
    that a search query involves the processing of personal data.
